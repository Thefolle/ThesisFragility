# Recommendations from the wild analysis

## Recommendation W.0

The cause of fragility is traced back to the volatility of test cases, which increases as they cover more features of the AUT, as written:
> Low-level tests are faster and more stable

## Recommendation W.1

Lower-level tests are more fragile since they depend upon implementation details: the recommendation should be read and interpreted keeping in mind this assumption.
