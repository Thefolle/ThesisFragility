[List of testing tools](https://www.guru99.com/testing-tools.html)

The goal of the list above is exploiting different testing tools so as to minimize the bias given by the usage of just one tool.

Here follows another list of tools, found unexpectedly on the web:

- [Cypress](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices): free; visual and DOM based; famous; alternative to Selenium;
- [TestQuality](https://www.testquality.com/): free; evaluate tests robustness based on the number of versions they pass/fail: here a [demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym0XhakmDNI&t=433s);

## Which tools does the community offer?

Here are the tools found on the whole GitHub by leveraging the search bar on the official website. The search key was `fragility test`:

- [FluentBuilder](https://github.com/robsoncastilho/FluentBuilder): a wrapper library that helps in writing less fragile unit tests;
- [XState](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate): a tool that lets programmers define a state machine of a JavaScript AUT; this tool is then used to facilitate testing;
- [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer): screenshot tool for single-page applications;
- [test_center](https://github.com/lyndsey-ferguson/fastlane-plugin-test_center): a wrapper that executes tests multiple times so as to probe false negative tests due to a fragile infrastructure that causes random failures;
- [Pyccuracy](https://github.com/heynemann/pyccuracy/wiki/Overview): framework to drive the development through acceptance test cases; based on Selenium Server;
