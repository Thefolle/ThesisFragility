# ThesisFragility

This is a repository intended for a thesis. The topic is about decreasing fragility of GUI test cases through a [linter](./Lint/testfragilitylint).

The current folder instead stores the main documents related to the thesis: the [spreadsheet](./TestCollection.et) containing the recorded modifications from diff files, [UML diagrams](./Diagrams), a listing on [GUI test tools](<./Testing tools.md>) that are currently available and so on.
